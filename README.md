# PyPacDev

A Python Pygame implementation of PacMan!

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed. The project relies on external libraries which can loosely be thought of similarly to Node.js `package.json` dependencies. In Python, these are conventionally tracked in a `requirements.txt` file.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal from the root folder of the project to install `pygame` and any other required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Game
Once your dependencies are installed, you can launch the game using:
```bash
python PyPacDev.py
```
